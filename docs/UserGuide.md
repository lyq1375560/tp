# ClientEase User Guide

**ClientEase is a lightweight customer contact manager designed for tech-savvy home-based online business owners** who manage a small to medium customer base,
perform frequent daily updates to customer contact information, and prefer fast, command-line-style text input over
GUI-driven interactions.

Instead of clicking through multiple menus, ClientEase lets you type short commands to add customers, search by fields,
track products and deadlines, and retrieve information instantly, keeping your records organised without the overhead
of full-scale business management systems.

**Scenario:** You run a home bakery and receive orders through chat and email. Throughout the day you need to update
phone numbers, delivery locations, and due dates quickly while keeping a clear view of open orders. ClientEase lets you
do those updates in seconds with short commands, without switching between multiple windows.

- If you are new to ClientEase, start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.
- If you are looking for a specific command, jump to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).
- If you are a developer, refer to the [Developer Guide](https://ay2526s2-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

## Who Is This Guide For?

ClientEase is built for **home-based online business owners** who:

- Manage a **small to medium customer base** (typically under a few hundred contacts)
- Perform **frequent daily updates** to customer information, such as new orders, contact changes, or delivery deadlines
- Prefer **keyboard-driven workflows** over clicking through menus

This guide assumes you are comfortable with:

| Assumed Skill | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|
| Basic terminal use | Opening a terminal, using `cd` to navigate folders, running `java -jar` commands |
| Simple command syntax | Typing structured commands like `add name/John Doe contact/98765432` |
| Reading on-screen feedback | Interpreting short success or error messages shown in the app |
| Basic data awareness | Understanding that your data is stored in a local file, and knowing to back it up |

> **Not sure if ClientEase is right for you?** If you manage more than a few hundred customers with complex team
> workflows, you may want a full-scale customer relationship management (CRM) system instead.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed. Verify by running:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
   > **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed
   > [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest **`clientease.jar`** file from the
   [releases page here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/releases).

3. Move the file to a folder you want to use as your **home folder** (e.g., `~/ClientEase/`).

4. Open a terminal and navigate to that folder:
   ```
   cd ~/ClientEase
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```
   java -jar clientease.jar
   ```

   ClientEase will launch with a set of sample customer data so you can explore right away.

---

### Your First Commands

Here is a short walkthrough to get familiar with ClientEase. Try each command by typing it into the command box and
pressing **Enter**.

**Step 1 - See what's already in the app:**
```
list
```
Expected output: All sample customers are shown in the Customer List Panel.

**Step 2 - Add your first real customer:**
```
add name/Jane Tan contact/91234567;jane@mybusiness.com \
products/Chocolate Cake:2, Muffin:5 location/Tampines deadline/2025-12-31
```
Type the command on one line without the `\`.
Expected output: `Added Customer: Jane Tan`

**Step 3 - Find a customer by name:**
```
find Jane
```
Expected output: Only customers whose name matches "Jane" are shown.

**Step 4 - Update a customer's contact details:**
```
edit 1 contact/99887766
```
Expected output: The first customer's contact details are updated.

**Step 5 - Delete a customer:**
```
delete 1
```
Expected output: The 1st customer in the list is deleted.

**Step 6 - Exit the app:**
```
exit
```
Expected output: `Goodbye! Exiting ClientEase. You have <N> customer(s) saved.`

> **Tip:** All your data is saved automatically after every command. You never need to press a "Save" button.

## Features

### Notes on Command Format

> **Read this before using any command.**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are **parameters you supply**. For example, in `add name/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual
  name, e.g. `add name/John Doe`.
- Items in `[square brackets]` are **optional**. For example, `name/NAME [contact/CONTACT]` can be used with or without
  a contact.
- Parameters can be entered **in any order**. For example, `add name/John Doe contact/98765432` is the same as
  `add contact/98765432 name/John Doe`.
- Commands that take no parameters (e.g. `help`, `list`, `exit`) will **ignore any extra text** you type after them.
- Line breaks and trailing `\` in examples are **for readability only**. Type the full command on a single line without `\`.
- If you are using a **PDF version** of this guide, be careful when copying multi-line commands — line breaks may cause
  spaces to be omitted.

---

### Viewing Help : `help`

Opens a help window that provides a quick overview of available commands and a link to the full User Guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format:** `help`

### Notes

- The help window does **not block** the main application — you can continue using ClientEase while it is open.
- If the help window is already open, running `help` again will focus on the existing window.
- The `help` command ignores any extra text after it.

> **Tip:** Use the help window as a quick reference when you forget command formats, instead of searching through the full guide.

---

### Adding a Customer : `add`

Adds a new customer record to ClientEase.

**Format:**
```
add name/NAME [products/PRODUCTS] [location/LOCATION] [deadline/DEADLINE] [contact/CONTACT]
```

**Parameter details:**

| Parameter | Required? | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `deadline/DEADLINE` | No | Accepted formats: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd/MM/yyyy`. Entries without a time default to **23:59**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `contact/CONTACT` | No | One or more phone numbers and/or emails, separated by semicolons. Phone: either an 8-digit local number or `+<country code><number>` (2–3 digit country code + 1–12 digit number). Spaces in phone numbers are ignored. Email: up to 100 characters, letters/digits/dots/hyphens, with exactly one `@` and an alphanumeric at the start of the domain. Empty entries (e.g. trailing or double `;`) are invalid. |

> **Important:** ClientEase automatically tags customers with a priority colour based on the **total quantity** of
> products. Green (Low) = 1–5 items, Yellow (Medium) = 6–10 items, Red (High) = 11+ items. If you omit a quantity, it
> counts as 1 toward the total.

**Other constraints:**

- Shorthands `n/`, `p/`, `l/`, `d/`, and `c/` are accepted.
- Each prefix can appear at most once.
- Unrecognised `<word>/` prefixes are rejected.
- Optional fields can be omitted.
- If a prefix is provided with no value (e.g. `products/`), the field is treated as empty.
- Non-ASCII characters (e.g. Chinese) are rejected in `name/`, `products/`, and `contact/`. `location/` currently accepts
  any characters as long as it is non-empty and within the length limit.

> **Warning:** If you try to add a customer with a name that already exists (case-insensitive, extra spaces ignored),
> ClientEase will reject the entry and display an error. Check the existing list with `list` before adding.

**Products are listed as a numbered list under each customer card.**

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Add a customer with full details**
```
add name/John Doe contact/98765432;johnd@example.com \
products/Chocolate Cake:2, Muffin:5 location/Clementi Ave 2 deadline/2025-12-31
```
Type the command on one line without the `\`.
Effect: Adds a customer named John Doe with products, location, deadline (31 Dec 2025 at 23:59), and contact details.

**Example 2: Add a customer with name only**
```
add name/Sarah Lim
```
Effect: Adds a customer named Sarah Lim with no other details. You can `edit` to fill in the rest later.

- The app will close automatically after a short delay.

---

## Saving the Data

ClientEase **automatically saves** your data to disk after every command that changes data. There is no Save button and
no need to save manually.

Your data is stored at:
```
[home folder]/data/ClientEase.json
```

---

## Editing the Data File

Advanced users may edit the data file directly using any text editor.

> **Caution:** If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, ClientEase will discard all data and start with
> an empty data file at the next run. It is recommended to back up the file before editing it.
>
> Certain edits can also cause ClientEase to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the
> acceptable range). Edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientEase home folder.

---
**Q: Can I have two customers with the same name?**

A: No. ClientEase treats names as unique identifiers (case-insensitive, extra spaces ignored). If two customers share a
name, consider differentiating them, e.g. `John Doe (Clementi)` and `John Doe (Tampines)`.

---

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. Workaround: delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. Workaround: manually restore the minimized Help Window.
