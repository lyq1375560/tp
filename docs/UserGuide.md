# ClientEase User Guide

**ClientEase is a lightweight customer contact manager designed for tech-savvy home-based online business owners** who manage a small to medium customer base,
perform frequent daily updates to customer contact information, and prefer fast, command-line-style text input over
GUI-driven interactions.

Instead of clicking through multiple menus, ClientEase lets you type short commands to add customers, search by fields,
track products and deadlines, and retrieve information instantly, keeping your records organised without the overhead
of full-scale business management systems.

- If you are new to ClientEase, start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.
- If you are looking for a specific command, jump to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).
- If you are a developer, refer to the [Developer Guide](https://ay2526s2-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

## Who Is This Guide For?

ClientEase is built for **home-based online business owners** who:

- Manage a **small to medium customer base** (typically under a few hundred contacts)
- Perform **frequent daily updates** to customer information, such as new orders, contact changes, or delivery deadlines
- Prefer **keyboard-driven workflows** over clicking through menus

This guide assumes you are comfortable with:

| Assumed Skill | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|
| Basic terminal use | Opening a terminal, using `cd` to navigate folders, running `java -jar` commands |
| Simple command syntax | Typing structured commands like `add name/John Doe contact/98765432` |
| Reading on-screen feedback | Interpreting short success or error messages shown in the app |
| Basic data awareness | Understanding that your data is stored in a local file, and knowing to back it up |

> **Not sure if ClientEase is right for you?** If you manage more than a few hundred customers with complex team
> workflows, you may want a full-scale CRM instead.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed. Verify by running:
   ```
   java -version
   ```
   > **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed
   > [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest **`clientease.jar`** file from the
   [releases page here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/releases).

3. Move the file to a folder you want to use as your **home folder** (e.g., `~/ClientEase/`).

4. Open a terminal and navigate to that folder:
   ```
   cd ~/ClientEase
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```

## Features

### Notes on Command Format

> **Read this before using any command.**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are **parameters you supply**. For example, in `add name/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual
  name, e.g. `add name/John Doe`.
- Items in `[square brackets]` are **optional**. For example, `name/NAME [contact/CONTACT]` can be used with or without
  a contact.
- Parameters can be entered **in any order**. For example, `add name/John Doe contact/98765432` is the same as
  `add contact/98765432 name/John Doe`.
- Commands that take no parameters (e.g. `help`, `list`, `exit`) will **ignore any extra text** you type after them.
- If you are using a **PDF version** of this guide, be careful when copying multi-line commands — line breaks may cause
  spaces to be omitted.

---

### Viewing Help : `help`

Opens a help window that provides a quick overview of available commands and a link to the full User Guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format:** `help`

### Notes

- The help window does **not block** the main application — you can continue using ClientEase while it is open.
- If the help window is already open, running `help` again will focus on the existing window.
- Command ignore extra space

> [!TIP]
> Use the help window as a quick reference when you forget command formats, instead of searching through the full guide.

---

### Adding a Customer : `add`

Adds a new customer record to ClientEase.

**Format:**
```
add name/NAME [products/PRODUCTS] [location/LOCATION] [deadline/DEADLINE] [contact/CONTACT]
```

**Parameter details:**

| Parameter | Required? | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name/NAME` | Yes | 1-100 characters after trimming and space normalisation. Only ASCII letters (A-Z), spaces, `.`, `'`, and `-`. Must contain at least one letter. Names are unique case-insensitively and with repeated spaces collapsed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `products/PRODUCTS` | No | Comma-separated list of product names from the product catalog. There is no fixed limit on the number of product names, but quantities must not exceed 10,000 per product or 100,000 in total. Items can optionally include a quantity using a colon (e.g., Muffin:3); if omitted, quantity defaults to 1. Matching is case-insensitive and spaces are normalised. Empty items are invalid. Duplicate product names are allowed and their quantities are summed. Use `product add` to create products before referencing them. |
| `location/LOCATION` | No | Non-blank after trimming. Maximum length 200 characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `deadline/DEADLINE` | No | Accepted formats: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd/MM/yyyy` (24-hour time). Entries without a time default to **23:59**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `contact/CONTACT` | No | Semicolon-separated entries. Each entry must be either an 8-digit local phone number or an international phone in `+<2-3 digit country code><1-12 digit number>` format; spaces in phone numbers are ignored. Emails are up to 100 characters, must start with an alphanumeric character, contain only letters, digits, dots, and hyphens, and contain exactly one `@` with an alphanumeric at the start of the domain. Entries are stored with phone spaces removed and emails lowercased, then sorted. Empty entries (e.g. trailing or double `;`) are invalid. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Priority Tagging:**
> ClientEase automatically tags customers with a priority color based on the **total quantity** of products:
> * **Green (Low):** 1–5 total items
> * **Yellow (Medium):** 6–10 total items
> * **Red (High):** 11 or more total items
> * No priority tag is shown if the customer has no products.

**Other constraints:**

- Shorthands `n/`, `p/`, `l/`, `d/`, and `c/` are accepted.
- Each prefix can appear at most once.
- Unrecognised `<word>/` prefixes are rejected.
- Optional fields can be omitted.
- For optional fields, if a prefix is provided with no value (e.g. `products/`), the field is treated as empty.
- Non-ASCII characters (e.g. Chinese) are rejected in `name/` and `contact/`. `products/` values must match product
  names already in the product catalog (case-insensitive, spaces normalised). Product names cannot contain `,` or `:`.
  `location/` accepts any characters as long as it is non-blank and within the length limit.

> [!WARNING]
> If you try to add a customer with a name that already exists (case-insensitive, spaces normalised),
> ClientEase will reject the entry and display an error. Check the existing list with `list` before adding.

**Products are shown as a bulleted list with quantities (e.g., `- Muffin (x2)`). If no products are provided, the card shows `Products: None`.**

**Examples:**

```
add name/John Doe contact/98765432;johnd@example.com products/Chocolate Cake:2, Muffin:5 location/Clementi Ave 2 deadline/2025-12-31
```
Adds a customer named John Doe, with two unique products with specified quantities, a location, a deadline of 31 Dec 2025 at 23:59, and two contact
details.

---

## Saving the Data

ClientEase **automatically saves** your data to disk after every command that changes data. There is no Save button and
no need to save manually.

Your data is stored at:
```
[home folder]/data/ClientEase.json
```

---

## Editing the Data File

Advanced users may edit the data file directly using any text editor.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientEase will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
>
> Furthermore, certain edits can cause ClientEase to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientEase home folder.

---
**Q: Can I have two customers with the same name?**

A: No. ClientEase treats names as unique identifiers (case-insensitive, spaces normalised). If two customers share a
name, consider differentiating them, e.g. `John Doe (Clementi)` and `John Doe (Tampines)`.

---

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

> [!TIP]
> **Shorthand Prefixes:**
> For the `add` and `edit` commands, you can use shorter versions of the prefixes to save time:
> * `n/` instead of `name/`
> * `p/` instead of `products/`
> * `l/` instead of `location/`
> * `d/` instead of `deadline/`
> * `c/` instead of `contact/`
>
> *Example:* `add n/John Doe p/Muffin` is equivalent to `add name/John Doe products/Muffin`.
