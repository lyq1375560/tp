# ClientEase User Guide

**ClientEase is designed for tech-savvy home-based online business owners** who manage a small to medium customer base,
perform frequent daily updates to customer contact information, and prefer fast, command-line-style text input over
GUI-driven interactions.

Instead of clicking through multiple menus, ClientEase lets you type short commands to add customers, search by fields,
track products and deadlines, and retrieve information instantly, keeping your records organised without the overhead
of full-scale business management systems.

- If you are new to ClientEase, start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.
- If you are looking for a specific command, jump to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).
- If you are a developer, refer to the [Developer Guide](https://ay2526s2-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

## Who Is This Guide For?

ClientEase is built for **home-based online business owners** who:

- Manage a **small to medium customer base** (typically under a few hundred contacts)
- Perform **frequent daily updates** to customer information, such as new orders, contact changes, or delivery deadlines
- Prefer **keyboard-driven workflows** over clicking through menus

This guide assumes you are comfortable with:

| Assumed Skill | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|
| Basic terminal use | Opening a terminal, using `cd` to navigate folders, running `java -jar` commands |
| Simple command syntax | Typing structured commands like `add name/John Doe contact/98765432` |
| Reading on-screen feedback | Interpreting short success or error messages shown in the app |
| Basic data awareness | Understanding that your data is stored in a local file, and knowing to back it up |

> **Not sure if ClientEase is right for you?** If you manage more than a few hundred customers with complex team
> workflows, you may want a full-scale CRM instead.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed. Verify by running:

   > **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed

## Features

### Notes on Command Format

> **Read this before using any command.**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are **parameters you supply**. For example, in `add name/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual
  name, e.g. `add name/John Doe`.
- Items in `[square brackets]` are **optional**. For example, `name/NAME [contact/CONTACT]` can be used with or without
  a contact.
- Parameters can be entered **in any order**. For example, `add name/John Doe contact/98765432` is the same as
  `add contact/98765432 name/John Doe`.
- Commands that take no parameters (e.g. `help`, `list`, `exit`) will **ignore any extra text** you type after them.
- If you are using a **PDF version** of this guide, be careful when copying multi-line commands — line breaks may cause
  spaces to be omitted.

---

### Viewing Help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format:** `help`

---

### Adding a Customer : `add`

Adds a new customer record to ClientEase.

**Format:**
```
add name/NAME [products/PRODUCTS] [location/LOCATION] [deadline/DEADLINE] [contact/CONTACT]
```

**Parameter details:**

| Parameter | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name/NAME` | Yes | 1-100 characters after trimming and space normalisation. Only ASCII letters (A-Z), spaces, `.`, `'`, and `-`. Must contain at least one letter. Names are unique case-insensitively and with repeated spaces collapsed. |
| `products/PRODUCTS` | No | Comma-separated list of 1-5 items chosen from: Muffin, Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Cake, Brownie, Cookie. Matching is case-insensitive. Empty items are invalid. |
| `location/LOCATION` | No | Non-blank after trimming. Maximum length 200 characters. |
| `deadline/DEADLINE` | No | Accepted formats: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, `yyyy-MM-dd`, `dd/MM/yyyy`. Entries without a time default to **23:59**. |
| `contact/CONTACT` | No | Semicolon-separated entries. Each entry must be either an 8-digit local phone number or an international phone in `+<2-3 digit country code><1-12 digit number>` format; spaces in phone numbers are ignored. Emails are up to 100 characters, must start with an alphanumeric character, contain only letters, digits, dots, and hyphens, and contain exactly one `@` with an alphanumeric at the start of the domain. Empty entries (e.g. trailing or double `;`) are invalid. |

**Other constraints:**

- Shorthands `n/`, `p/`, `l/`, `d/`, and `c/` are accepted.
- Each prefix can appear at most once.
- Unrecognised `<word>/` prefixes are rejected.
- Optional fields can be omitted.
- If a prefix is provided with no value (e.g. `products/`), the field is treated as empty.
- Non-ASCII characters (e.g. Chinese) are rejected in `name/`, `products/`, and `contact/`. `location/` currently accepts
  any characters as long as it is non-blank and within the length limit.

> **Warning:** If you try to add a customer with a name that already exists (case-insensitive, spaces normalised),
> ClientEase will reject the entry and display an error. Check the existing list with `list` before adding.

**Products are listed as a numbered list under each customer card.**

**Examples:**

```
add name/John Doe contact/98765432;johnd@example.com products/Chocolate Cake, Muffin location/Clementi Ave 2 deadline/2025-12-31
```
Adds a customer named John Doe, with two products, a location, a deadline of 31 Dec 2025 at 23:59, and two contact
details.

---

## Saving the Data

ClientEase **automatically saves** your data to disk after every command that changes data. There is no Save button and
no need to save manually.

Your data is stored at:
```
[home folder]/data/ClientEase.json
```

---

## Editing the Data File

Advanced users may edit the data file directly using any text editor.

> **Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientEase will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
>
> Furthermore, certain edits can cause ClientEase to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientEase home folder.

---
**Q: Can I have two customers with the same name?**

A: No. ClientEase treats names as unique identifiers (case-insensitive, spaces normalised). If two customers share a
name, consider differentiating them, e.g. `John Doe (Clementi)` and `John Doe (Tampines)`.

---

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
